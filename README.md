# AWS_Kinesis_data_stream

This project demonstrates the development of a real-time data streaming application using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. The application includes producers for ingesting data into the stream and consumers for processing and analyzing the streaming data. The primary goal is to handle large amounts of data in real-time, enabling diverse use cases such as real-time analytics, monitoring, and log processing.

Let’s talk streaming data. You want to read data and stream it into another program or different uses for gain. Your data suddenly comes to life and can be used to do amazing things. You could even launch a rocket using a text file if you wanted. Here, your imagination is your limit. Let’s dive into a step-by-step journey on how to stream data on AWS. Let’s dig in.
